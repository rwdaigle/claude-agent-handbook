Claude Code was the world's first example of an agent that could perform long-running and sophisticated tasks in a complex and unbounded domain.

The framework that powers Claude Code has since been extracted to the [Claude Agent SDK][1], allowing others to build agentic systems of their own.

This handbook attempts to capture the real-world learnings, patterns, and approaches of building agents with the Claude Agent SDK.

It is intentionally terse.
